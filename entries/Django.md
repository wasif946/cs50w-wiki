# Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern. Created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison in 2003, Django was released publicly in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular web frameworks.

## Core Philosophy

Django follows several key principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Encourage code reusability
2. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Clear, readable code over magic
3. **Loose coupling**: Different parts of the application should be independent
4. **Rapid development**: Focus on quick, efficient development
5. **Batteries included**: Comprehensive built-in features

## Key Components

### 1. Models
Models define your database structure using Python classes:

```python
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
